# Meal Database Project
This project uses the API from themealdb.com in order to search for the meals.
We used Firebase to both store the user information as well as using it as authentication for logging in/signing up.

## Features
  - A full login and signup page which uses firebase authentication to store user emails.
  - A homepage with a searchbar to search for meals using the API from themealdb.com
  - Integration with LocalStorage to save previous searches.
